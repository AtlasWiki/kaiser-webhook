# Kaiser-Webhook

Kaiser Webhook is a tool that was made for hosting an exploit server locally/remotely. Currently it is used to detect certain blind attacks like XSS and HTML injections. 
Not only does it log requests, alerts, and the attack vector, but it uses discord webhooks to output the results in your discord channel. A demo version can be seen at
